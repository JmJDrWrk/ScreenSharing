# ScreenSharing

I created this script because I needed to use a Raspberry Pi without a screen. By referencing this script in a Raspberry Pi OS service file, I can now see what's happening on the Pi whenever it turns on, as long as I know the IP address of the device.

## Steps to Achieve the Same Setup

1.  **Copy Files**: Copy your Python script to a known directory, along with the provided `cursor.png` image.
    
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. You can test the script by running `python3 script.py` to confirm it's working. If it doesn't run manually, it won't work automatically at startup.
    
3.  **Create the Service File**: Open a terminal and create a new systemd service file:
    
    bash
    
    Copiar c贸digo
    
    `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/screen_streamer.service` 
    
4.  **Add the Following Content**:
    
    
    [Unit]
    Description=Flask Screen Streaming Service
    After=graphical.target
    
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/screen_streamer.py
    WorkingDirectory=/home/pi
    StandardOutput=inherit
    StandardError=inherit
    Restart=always
    User=pi
    Environment=DISPLAY=:0
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=graphical.target
    
5.  **Enable and Start the Service**:
    
    bash
    
    Copiar c贸digo
    
    `sudo systemctl enable screen_streamer.service
    sudo systemctl start screen_streamer.service
    sudo systemctl status screen_streamer.service` 
    
6.  **Check the Service Status**: The `status` command should show something like "active". If you encounter issues, you can check the logs with:
    
    bash
    
    Copiar c贸digo
    
    `sudo journalctl -u screen_streamer.service -b` 
    

## Testing

To verify it's working on the Raspberry Pi itself (if you have a screen connected), open a web browser and navigate to `localhost:5000/screen`. If nothing appears, the script may not be functioning properly.

Once confirmed to be working, you can reboot your system. Then, from another device on the same network, access the stream by entering the Raspberry Pi's IP address in a browser, followed by `:5000/screen`. For example:

bash

Copiar c贸digo

`192.168.54.177:5000/screen`
